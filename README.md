# Raihan Khairul Rochman

Hello, there! I'm a software developer and a computer science enthusiast. I like to write code, explore the internet, and learn new technologies. I have interest and few knowledges in various subjects of software engineering. Software development, web development, mobile development, cyber security, quality assurance, system administration, machine learning, devops, and possibly much more in the future! I might not master them all&mdash;perhaps a jack of all trades, master of few. But, I like to learn new things everyday!
